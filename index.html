            <h2>What is Car Detailing?</h2>
            <p>Car detailing is a comprehensive cleaning and restoration process for both the exterior and interior of your vehicle. It involves deep cleaning, polishing, and protecting various surfaces, including paint, upholstery, and wheels.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Maintaining the Exterior Appearance</h2>

Interior detailing includes deep cleaning of carpets, upholstery, and other surfaces. It helps remove dirt, stains, and odors that can accumulate over time, while also protecting upholstery and leather from cracking and fading due to UV exposure.</p>
